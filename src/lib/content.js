		"desc": "An allergy refers to an exaggerated reaction by our immune system in response to bodily contact with a foreign substance. Allergy-producing substances are called \"allergens\" Examples of allergens include pollen, dust mite, mould, danders and food.Common allergic conditions include hay fever, asthma, allergic eczema, hives, allergic eyes and allergic rhinitis.An undetected allergy or intolerance can lead to a later cross reaction to other foods, however, in many instances difficulties arise in pinpointing the food allergens involved in causing allergy symptoms. Allergic conditions can be diagnosed in various ways, such as skin or blood tests and will help to identify the foods or substances that induce allergic responses or symptoms.",

		"desc": "A carbon laser peel is a revolutionary laser treatment that is completely painless with minimal-to-zero downtime. It is highly beneficial for people with oily skin, blackheads, enlarged pores, dull skin, and acne on the face or body. It is also an excellent way to exfoliate and refresh your skin, providing an instant refreshed appearance and leaving skin feeling softer, smoother and firmer.A layer of liquid carbon is applied to the skin, where it penetrates deep into the pores. Laser light is highly attracted to the carbon particles. When the laser is passed over the area, it destroys the carbon, taking dead skin cells, contaminants and oil with it.This treatment provides several benefits.",

		"slug": "chemical-peel",
		"title": "Chemical Peel",
		"desc": "Chemical Peel involves applying a thin layer of chemical agent on the skin to remove the dry dead layer on the surface, therefore creating a smoother and fresher-looking skin. The deeper the peel, the more extensive the skin is renewed. Medium and deep peels stimulate collagen renewal, resulting in firmer and tighter skin.Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is the commonest kind of chemical peeling agent used. This is a group of acids commonly known as fruit acids and includes glycolic acid, lactic acid and citric acid. Glycolic acid is the commonest used and this provides a superficial peel. Other chemical agents include TCA and Jessner's solution. These penetrate deeper than glycolic acid giving medium to deep peels.",
